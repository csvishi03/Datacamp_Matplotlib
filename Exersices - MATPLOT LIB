SCATTER AND LINE PLOTS

Line plot (1)
With matplotlib, you can create a bunch of different plots in Python. The most basic plot is the line plot. 
A general recipe is given here.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
In the video, you already saw how much the world population has grown over the past years. 
Will it continue to do so? The world bank has estimates of the world population for the years 1950 up to 2100.
The years are loaded in your workspace as a list called year, and the corresponding populations as a list called pop.





# Print the last item from year and pop
year
pop
print(year)
print(pop)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a line plot: year on the x-axis, pop on the y-axis
plt.plot(year,pop)
plt.show()



# Print the last item of gdp_cap and life_exp

print(gdp_cap[-1])
print(life_exp[-1])

# Make a line plot, gdp_cap on the x-axis, life_exp on the y-axis
plt.plot(gdp_cap,life_exp)

# Display the plot
plt.show()


# Change the line plot below to a scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Put the x-axis on a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Import package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Build Scatter plot
plt.scatter(pop, life_exp)
plt.xlabel("population")
plt.ylabel("Life expectancy")


# Show plot
plt.show()
