Build a histogram (1)
life_exp, the list containing data on the life expectancy for different countries in 2007, is available in your Python shell.

To see how life expectancy in different countries is distributed, let's create a histogram of life_exp.

matplotlib.pyplot is already available as plt.

INSTRUCTIONS
Use plt.hist() to create a histogram of the values in life_exp. Do not specify the number of bins; Python will set the number of bins to 10 by default for you.
Add plt.show() to actually display the histogram. Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?

# Create histogram of life_exp data
plt.hist(life_exp)

# Display histogram
plt.show()




Build a histogram (2): bins
In the previous exercise, you didn't specify the number of bins. By default, Python sets the number of bins to 10 in that case. The number of bins is pretty important. Too little bins oversimplifies reality, which doesn't show you the details. Too much bins overcomplicates reality and doesn't give the bigger picture.

To control the number of bins to divide your data in, you can set the bins argument.

That's exactly what you'll do in this exercise. You'll be making two plots here. The code in the script already includes plt.show() and plt.clf() calls; plt.show() displays a plot; plt.clf() cleans it up again so you can start afresh.

As before, life_exp is available and matploblib.pyplot is imported as plt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Build a histogram of life_exp, with 5 bins. Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?
Build another histogram of life_exp, this time with 20 bins. Is this better?

# Build histogram with 5 bins
plt.hist(life_exp,bins=5)

# Show and clean up plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Build histogram with 20 bins
plt.hist(life_exp,bins=20)

# Show and clean up again
plt.show()
plt.clf()


Build a histogram (3): compare
In the video, you saw population pyramids for the present day and for the future. Because we were using a histogram, it was very easy to make a comparison.

Let's do a similar comparison. life_exp contains life expectancy data for different countries in 2007. You also have access to a second list now, life_exp1950, containing similar data for 1950. Can you make a histogram for both datasets?

You'll again be making two plots. The plt.show() and plt.clf() commands to render everything nicely are already included. Also matplotlib.pyplot is imported for you, as plt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Build a histogram of life_exp with 15 bins.
Build a histogram of life_exp1950, also with 15 bins. Is there a big difference with the histogram for the 2007 data?


# Histogram of life_exp, 15 bins
plt.hist(life_exp,bins=15)

# Show and clear plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Histogram of life_exp1950, 15 bins
plt.hist(life_exp1950,bins=15)

# Show and clear plot again
plt.show()
plt.clf()

Labels
It's time to customize your own plot. This is the fun part, you will see your plot come to life!

You're going to work on the scatter plot with world development data: GDP per capita on the x-axis (logarithmic scale), life expectancy on the y-axis. The code for this plot is available in the script.

As a first step, let's add axis labels and a title to the plot. You can do this with the xlabel(), ylabel() and title() functions, available in matplotlib.pyplot. This sub-package is already imported as plt.


INSTRUCTIONS
The strings xlab and ylab are already set for you. Use these variables to set the label of the x- and y-axis.
The string title is also coded for you. Use it to add a title to the plot.
After these customizations, finish the script with plt.show() to actually display the plot.




# Basic scatter plot, log scale
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)
plt.xscale('log') 

# Strings
xlab = 'GDP per Capita [in USD]'
ylab = 'Life Expectancy [in years]'
title = 'World Development in 2007'

# Add axis labels
plt.xlabel(xlab)
plt.ylabel(ylab)



# Add title
plt.title(title)

# After customizing, display the plot
plt.show()

Ticks
The customizations you've coded up to now are available in the script, in a more concise form.

In the video, Filip has demonstrated how you could control the y-ticks by specifying two arguments:

plt.yticks([0,1,2], ["one","two","three"])
In this example, the ticks corresponding to the numbers 0, 1 and 2 will be replaced by one, two and tree, respectively.

Let's do a similar thing for the x-axis of your world development chart, with the xticks() function. The tick values 1000, 10000 and 100000 should be replaced by 1k, 10k and 100k. To this end, two lists have already been created for you: tick_val and tick_lab.

INSTRUCTIONS
Use tick_val and tick_lab as inputs to the xticks() function to make the the plot more readable.
As usual, display the plot with plt.show() after you've added the customizations.


# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')

# Definition of tick_val and tick_lab
tick_val = [1000,10000,100000]
tick_lab = ['1k','10k','100k']

# Adapt the ticks on the x-axis
plt.xticks(tick_val,tick_lab)

# After customizing, display the plot
plt.show()

Sizes
Right now, the scatter plot is just a cloud of blue dots, indistinguishable from each other. Let's change this. Wouldn't it be nice if the size of the dots corresponds to the population?

To accomplish this, there is a list pop loaded in your workspace. It contains population numbers for each country expressed in millions. You can see that this list is added to the scatter method, as the argument s, for size.


INSTRUCTIONS


Run the script to see how the plot changes.
Looks good, but increasing the size of the bubbles will make things stand out more.
Import the numpy package as np.
Use np.array() to create a numpy array from the list pop. Call this Numpy array np_pop.
Double the values in np_pop by assigning np_pop * 2 to np_pop again. Because np_pop is a Numpy array, each array element will be doubled.
Change the s argument inside plt.scatter() to be np_pop instead of pop.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Store pop as a numpy array: np_pop
np_pop=np.array(pop)

# Double np_pop
np_pop = np.array(pop)*2

# Update: set s argument to np_pop
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp, s = np_pop)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')
plt.xticks([1000, 10000, 100000],['1k', '10k', '100k'])

# Display the plot
plt.show()
plt.show()





Colors
The code you've written up to now is available in the script on the right.

The next step is making the plot more colorful! To do this, a list col has been created for you. It's a list with a color for each corresponding country, depending on the continent the country is part of.

How did we make the list col you ask? The Gapminder data contains a list continent with the continent each country belongs to. A dictionary is constructed that maps continents onto colors:

dict = {
    'Asia':'red',
    'Europe':'green',
    'Africa':'blue',
    'Americas':'yellow',
    'Oceania':'black'
}
Nothing to worry about now; you will learn about dictionaries in the next chapter.

INSTRUCTIONS

Add c = col to the arguments of the plt.scatter() function.
Change the opacity of the bubbles by setting the alpha argument to 0.8 inside plt.scatter(). Alpha can be set from zero to one, where zero totally transparant, and one is not transparant.


# Specify c and alpha inside plt.scatter()
np_pop = np.array(pop)
plt.scatter(x = gdp_cap, y = life_exp,s = (np_pop)*2 , c=col, alpha=0.8)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')
plt.xticks([1000,10000,100000], ['1k','10k','100k'])

# Show the plot
plt.show()


Additional Customizations
If you have another look at the script, under # Additional Customizations, you'll see that there are two plt.text() functions now. They add the words "India" and "China" in the plot.

INSTRUCTIONS
Add plt.grid(True) after the plt.text() calls so that gridlines are drawn on the plot.

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(x = gdp_cap, y = life_exp, s = np.array(pop) * 2, c = col, alpha = 0.8)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')
plt.xticks([1000,10000,100000], ['1k','10k','100k'])

# Additional customizations
plt.text(1550, 71, 'India')
plt.text(5700, 80, 'China')

# Add grid() call
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
